## Overview of the statistical analysis:

The purpose of this project was to explore NYC Citi Bikes data to see if opening up Citi Bikes in Des Moines, Iowa would be ideal. The data was pulled form CitiBikes website and provides ride data in August of 2019. With Tableau, I was able to illustrate Bike metrics and learn how the business performed and how it could relate to opening Business in Des Moines.

## Results:

## Summary:

Overall, most of the Citi Bike users were male subscribers taking short trips into NYC. Traffic was similar to rush our driving hours as users were probably taking the bikes to and from work. Based on the NYC data, Des Moines should expect similar results. Assuming weather does not play a role, Citi Bike can compare population size of new york and Des Moines to estimate the number of rides they should expect on a weekly basis. 

Further Research:

If I was to look further into the data, I would compare how weather data might have affected the data. On a rainy day, people may be more inclined to drive to work rather than taking a bike. If I could compare the number of rides during rainy weather and determine how it affects bike usage. Not only that, but I could compare weather patterns in Iowa to get a sense on how bike usage may vary in Des Moines. Building on this, I would also explore how the cost of the rides affects the usage. Companies such as CitiBike tend to raise prices during busier times of the day and during busy events. Depending on the cost of the ride, someone may not pay for the convience of the service. Not only that, but there may be an avaerage threshold that would help increase Citi Bike revenue.
